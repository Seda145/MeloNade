Using the application:

This is a work in progress, a very, very early version. Basic functionality is implemented but not perfected. It will be worked on over time. 

This browser application is a tool for musicians to analyze audio, microphone input and midi data for entertainment purposes.
You can play a music instrument through your microphone in realtime while music plays. The analyzer will attempt to track your playing accuracy.


Instructions:

1. Open app.html in your web browser.
2. Choose an audio file (music).
3. Choose a MIDI file containing 1 track, matching the audio file. Chord support has not yet been implemented. Bass guitar visualizer is implemented.
4. Press the "Play" button and give permission for access to your microphone. The "microphone" can be a connected music instrument, or if you wish use the windows "stereo mix" device to use system audio output as input data.
5. This is it. Notes are automatically generated on screen for you to play at the correct timing (midi), which will increase or decrease your score.
